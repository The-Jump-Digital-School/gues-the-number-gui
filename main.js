	   in your own. We won't worry about concepts like

	3. Display the lower and upper bound to the user. We
	   do this by using our lowerBound and upperBound
	   elements above and use their `innerHTML` property to
	   assign a new text/string value inside each of these
	   `<span>` tags. Be sure to look this up on MDN or
	   otherwise. (hint: game.lower and game.upper)

*/

/*

	4. Next, do something very similar but for our attempts
	   remaining. Our `game` object has a attemptsRemaining
	   method. Call this method and assign the value returned
	   to the innerHTML property of our guessesLeft span element.

*/

/*

	5. Add a click event listener to our help button. On click, call
	   the `game.help()` method and, based on the value returned,
	   ALERT to the user that their last guess was within 10 or 20
	   or whatever from the target answer.

*/

/*

	6. Finally, add a click listener to our guess button. Inside the
	   callback function, we need to fetch the value (almost as if it
	   is also the name of a property on our guessInput) of our guess
	   input field and then pass that value to `game.guess`. Be sure to
	   ensure the value is COERCED into a number from a string. Next,
	   ALERT the user if the guess was too high, too low, etc etc.
	   Lastly, call `game.attemptsRemaining` and assign that new value
	   to our guessesLeft span element by using `innerHTML`.

// If so, might we need to prevent some sort of default behaviour? Perhaps?
// Maybe? Quite possibly??? Hmmm....

// That's all folks! Good luck!!
